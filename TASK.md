# Task: Update CSS Buttons in Shift Timer

The goal of this task is to enhance the visual appearance of the buttons in the Shift Timer application (`src/index.html`). The current buttons use basic Tailwind CSS classes. We aim to provide a more premium, modern, and interactive feel using advanced CSS techniques like gradients, glassmorphism, and hover transitions.

## Requirements
- Improve the aesthetics of all buttons (Add Break, Remove Break, Calculate).
- Use a consistent and premium color palette.
- Add hover and active states for better interactivity.
- Ensure the design remains responsive and accessible.
- Fix calculation logic (breaks should add to shift time).
- Implement real-time clock and auto-updating logic.
- Resolve deployment conflicts by removing legacy `[site]` configuration for Cloudflare Pages.
