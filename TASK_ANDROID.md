# Task: Create Equivalent Kotlin Android App for Shift Timer

The goal of this task is to develop a native Android application using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose that replicates the functionality and premium aesthetics of the Shift Timer web application.

## Requirements
- **Native Kotlin**: Use Jetpack Compose for a modern UI.
- **Identical Logic**: Replicate the "Login + Shift + Breaks" calculation logic.
- **Real-Time Accuracy**: Implement a ticking clock and live countdown/overtime timer.
- **Premium Design**: Match the glassmorphism, gradients, and typography (Outfit font) of the web app.
- **GitHub Ready**: Organize the code within an `android` folder for easy release alongside the web version.

## Features
- Login Time selection (TimePicker).
- Adjustable Shift Hours (Decimal support).
- Dynamic list of Breaks (Add/Remove).
- Persistent Calculation (Update as you type).
- Dark/Light mode support (themed after the web app's dark palette).
